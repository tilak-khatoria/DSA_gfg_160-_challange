# DSA GFG 160 Challenge

Welcome to my GFG 160 Days of Code Challenge repository! 🚀

## 📚 About
This repository contains my solutions to the GeeksforGeeks 160 Days DSA Challenge. Each problem is solved using **multiple approaches** to demonstrate different problem-solving techniques and optimize for various constraints.

## 🗂️ Problem Organization

Each category folder contains individual problem folders structured as follows:

```
Category_Name/
└── Problem_Name/
    ├── README.md          # Problem statement and approach explanations
    ├── approach1.cpp      # First solution approach (e.g., Brute Force)
    ├── approach2.cpp      # Second solution approach (e.g., Optimized)
    ├── approach3.cpp      # Third solution approach (e.g., Space Optimized)
    └── ...
```

## 💡 Multiple Approaches

For each problem, I provide multiple solutions:
- **Approach 1**: Usually a brute force or naive solution for better understanding
- **Approach 2**: Optimized solution focusing on time complexity
- **Approach 3**: Further optimizations considering space complexity or alternative techniques
- **Additional Approaches**: Different algorithmic paradigms when applicable

## 📝 How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant category folder
2. Choose a problem folder
3. Read the `README.md` for problem details and approach comparisons
4. Review different solution files to understand various approaches

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Complete all 160 problems
- ✅ Provide multiple solutions per problem
- ✅ Explain time and space complexity for each approach
- ✅ Write clean, well-documented code

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- C++
- Python
- Java (where applicable)

## 📊 Progress

- **Total Problems**: 160
- **Completed**: In Progress
- **Current Streak**: Ongoing
